Hello. I've started my coding challenge. I've never used Ruby on Rails before. It has been interesting to learn the basics of this language.
I'm starting the challenge at 4:30 on 12/9/2018.

I was able to complete all the tasks except editing comments on a post. This was a fun challenge and I'm looking forward to learning more. All these files are zipped up and will be sent in an email due to issues github.

Regards,
Nick Daddona
